# Control Totals

This directory contains data and code related to the region's future year (e.g., 2045) forecasts for overall households, people, and jobs. These control totals provide regionwide forecast information on household counts/characterstics and employment counts in future years. They bring information from the regional models (REMI and demographic model) into UrbanSim. They also provide the only route for moving regional forecast information into the travel model.
