# ACS 2013-2017 create 2015 MAZ data for households by income.R
# Create "2015" MAZ data from ACS 2013-2017 
# SI

# Notes

"

1. ACS households by income data here are downloaded for the 2013-2017 5-year dataset. The end year can
   be updated by changing the *ACS_year* variable. 

2. 2010 decennial census household data at the block level were used to develop the share of households by
   each maz/block group combination relative to the block group total. That share was then applied to each
   household income category. Data were then totaled, rounded, with the largest income column adjusted so subtotals
   equal totals.

    * Because the 2017$ equivalent of $60,000 in 2000$ ($91,538) doesn't closely align with 2017 ACS income 
      categories, households within the $75,000-$99,999 category will be apportioned above and below $91,538. 
      Using the ACS 2013-2017 PUMS data, the share of Bay Area households above $91,538 within the $75,000-$99,999 
      category is 0.3113032.That is, approximately 30 percent of HHs in the $75,000-$99,999 category will be 
      apportioned above this value (Q3) and 70 percent below it (Q2). The table below compares 2000$ and 2017$.
