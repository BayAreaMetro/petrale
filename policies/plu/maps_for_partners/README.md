The goal is to share an ArcGIS online map with internal and external partners to communicate UrbanSim's inputs, in other words, UrbanSim's understanding of the base-year demographic, economic, and land use situations of the region, as well as key Blueprint strategies underpinning PBA50.  

Three layers of data:
* Base-year TAZ-level popoulation, household, employment, and housing units
* BASIS zoning BOC data at the jurisdiction/zone level which reflects the development capacity of the region's land under existing local zoning ordidances and general plans 
* Zoningmods which reflects the Blueprint strategies which, in UrbanSim's scenario simulations, overrides local zoning ordinances and general plans
